 What is Arduino?
 Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
 
 Why people use it?
 Arduino is used to create electronic devices capable of receiving signals from various digital and analog sensors that can be connected and control various Executive devices. The device projects based on Arduino, can work independently or to interact with the software on your computer (eg.: Flash, Processing, MaxMSP). Fees can be collected yourself or purchased in the collection. Development environment of open source text available for free download.

The Arduino programming language is an implementation of Wiring, a similar platform for the "physical computing" based on a multimedia programming environment Processing.

Why Arduino?

There are a lot of microcontrollers and platforms for the implementation of "physical computing". Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia''s BX-24, Phidgets, by mit's Handyboard, and many others offer similar functionality. All of these devices bring together the scattered information about programming and make it in an easy to use Assembly. The Arduino in turn also simplifies the process of working with microcontrollers, however, has several advantages over other devices for teachers, students, and fans:

Low-cost – Arduino boards are relatively cheap compared to other platforms. The cheapest version of the Arduino module can be assembled by hand, and some are even ready-made modules cost less than $ 50.

Cross-platform – the Arduino software runs under Windows, Macintosh OSX and Linux. Most microcontrollers are limited to Windows.

Simple and clear programming environment – the Arduino software is suitable for both beginners and experienced. Arduino-based programming environment Processing, which is very convenient for teachers , as students working with this environment and will be familiar with Arduino.

The software is expandable and open source – Arduino is available as a tool that can be augmented by experienced users. Language can be supplemented with C++ libraries. Users wishing to understand the technical nuances, have the opportunity to go into AVR C is based on C++. Accordingly, it is possible to add code from environment AVR C on Arduino program.

The hardware is expandable and open concepts – the ATMEGA8 and ATMEGA168 are Arduino based. The schema modules are released with a Creative Commons license, so experienced engineers are able to create their own versions of modules, expanding and complementing them. Even regular users can develop prototypes with the aim of saving money and understanding of the work.
